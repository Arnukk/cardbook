Cardbook
========
CardBook - exchanging personal information securely and anonymously never has been easier.Think how many times you tried to remember someone’s name when you spoke to him. When we first come to a new environment, we usually find it hard to remember new friends’ names, personal information or faces. Although sometimes we can recognize the face, we find it is hard to associate the picture with the name in our mind. These problems usually happen during business and social events. Traditionally we use paper made business cards to solve such problems. However as the electronic era evolves, the disadvantages of paper-based business cards become more obvious.
